//Six friends go on a trip and are looking for accommodation. 
// After looking for hours, they find a hotel which offers

//A double room costs Rs. X, while a triple room costs Rs. Y.

//The friends can either get three double rooms or get two triple rooms. Find the minimum amount they will have to pay to accommodate all six of them.
